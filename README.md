# Search DMV Command

This discord.js command will only work for those who own NAT2K15's [DMV Script](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/DMV-Script) and his [FiveM Bot V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/fivem-botv2).

* You can use his framework bot but you may have to adjust some code, ping me in the client support channel for support in [NAT2K15's Discord](https://discord.gg/nat2k15) for help.


# How to install

Simply drag and drop into the commands folder, restart your bot and boom!

### Usage
```!deleteveh <vehicleid>```
* Please do it without the <>
* Replace `!` with your prefix set in the config.

* You can get the Vehicle ID via my [Search DMV Command](https://github.com/lucasmckillop/search-dmv) or through your database.
